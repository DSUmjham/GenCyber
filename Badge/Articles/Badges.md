# Badge Types
You may have noticed there are some different colored badges around. They are all part of the game and may be helpful to you. Try and scan some of the different types to see what happens.

## Blue Badge (Participant)
The blue badges (which you most likely have) are the standard participant badge. They are fully featured, upgradable, and sometimes exhibit strange behavior...it's all part of the game.

## Red Badge (Camp Staff)
If you see someone walking around with a red badge, they are one of our camp staff. These people are helping out in class, giving electives, and hanging around camp all day; some are current students or alumni! They're happy to answer your questions and let you scan their badges too.

## Yellow Badge (Challenge)
There is a small number of yellow badges available at camp. These badges are associated with specific challenges and other camp initiatives, like being a superb participant. If you get a chance to scan a yellow badge, you've done something great. 

You'll also receive a digital badge which can be seen at the kiosk stations!

## Black Badge (Uber)
The most elite of our badges, you won't see tons of them around! Wearers of uber badges have had an integral part in the camp, won competitive GenCyber challenges, or done some exceptional work. These badges have some functionality that the others don't...but what could that be?
