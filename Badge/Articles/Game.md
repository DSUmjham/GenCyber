# The Game
Your buy-in for the game is getting a badge built and registered with camp staff. Once that is done, the competition begins! The overall premise of the game is pretty simple: connect with as many *unique* badges as possible. Whoever collects the most wins the game.

## Gameplay
 1. Find another camp-goer who is willing to connect badges.
 2. Place your badge into receive mode by clicking the button labeled **SW2**
 3. While your badge is listening in receive mode, have the other person transmit their badge info to you; they will need to click **SW1** on their badge to transmit the data.
 4. When receiving data, your badge will blink blue to show the bitstream coming in.
 5. If you scanned a new badge, your badge will display a green LED. If unsuccessful or if it was not a unique badge, your LED will light up red.
 6. Be courteous, flip the process and send them your info too. Teamwork makes the dream work.

### Helpful Hints
 - No need to hold the buttons down, just click and release.
 - When in receive mode, your badge will listen until it recognizes another GenCyber badge. If it doesn't detect one for three seconds, it will go back to sleep.
 - The badges do have some range to them, but a foot or two between each of them is ideal.

## Winning

Each camp will have a different number of participants and staff helping out. The first person to collect all of the badges wins the game. If nobody has gotten all of them by the end of camp, the person with the most gets the win. You can check your current status in a couple of different ways:

 1. Scan your badge at one of the scoring kiosks to see your overall score. 
 2. Press both **SW1** and **SW2** simultaneously and your RGB LED will give you an on-board indicator.
