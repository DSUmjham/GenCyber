# Badge Assembly
The first objective you have is to assemble your badge. Make sure you've got a good grasp on the components you are working with and soldering safely before starting this!

The order of assembly is not critical, but this approach should work well:
 1. Verify you have all of the parts needed:
	 1. Badge PCB
	 2.  Battery Holder
	 3. Battery
	 4. Resistor 56 Ohm % $\frac{1}{4}$Watt
	 5. IR Receiver
	 6. RGB LED 5MM
	 7. IR Transmitter 5MM
	 8. 2 Pushbuttons
	 9. DIP Socket
	 10. Microcontroller ATTINy
