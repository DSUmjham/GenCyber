## The Badge
This is the first (that we know of) electronic badge designed for use in a GenCyber camp! The badge offers participants an opportunity to master soldering, and the six security concepts. This device is also capable of communicating with others like it over Infrared (IR), which is a great way to meet the other participants. A successfully-built badge allows participants to join our camp game in pursuit of the highest score.
